            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p>Google</p>

            <p>
                Google's home page is a perfect example of the usage of white space in web design. Their home page
                contains two things, their logo and a search bar. They know that the only reason that people are
                visiting that page is to search for something, so they don't bog down their page with added content to
                fill the page. They use the white space to convey a clean, professional look that doesn't interfere with
                the user experience.

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p>Best Buy</p>
            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/">https://www.bestbuy.com/</a>
            <br>
            <img src="images/www.bestbuy.com_.png" alt="Best Buy Home Page Screenshot">
            <p>
                Best Buy's home page is an excellent example of the importance of repetition in design. As a retailer,
                Best Buy offers a wide variety of products that are quite diverse. In order to tie all of these products
                together in a cohesive experience, they use repetition. All of the text matches and the colors used
                throughout the page all tie into Best Buy's color scheme. The navigation menu and the buttons all share
                the same blue color so that the user always feels like they are on the same site as they navigate from
                page to page. This concept prevents users from becoming disoriented as they browse.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>Bungie</p>
            <a href="https://www.bungie.net/">https://www.bungie.net/</a>
            <br>
            <img src="images/www.bungie.net_.png" alt="Bungie.net Home Page Screenshot">
            <p>
                The Bungie home page shows an excellent use of contrast to capture the attention of the user. The Text
                is all a light color to stand out against the darker background. This allows for easy readability and
                also conveys the message without distractions. The images used convey the message of their product
                without overpowering the message of the text. Contrast is a powerful tool in the process of development.
